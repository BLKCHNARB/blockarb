                Auto.Arbitrage is a fund focused on generating yield within the cryptocurrency space
                through a wide array of arbitrage and relative value strategies. The fund seeks
                absolute returns without taking a directional view on the cryptocurrency market.

                Auto.Arbitrage delivers consistent positive returns within a strictly defined risk framework by
                exploiting a highly fragmented market place with extreme volatility, high momentum, temporary
                dislocation and lower liquidity. This strategy is not designed to give a directional exposure to
                crypto assets but instead will deliver uncorrelated positive returns with a high Sharpe ratio.

                The fund is suitable for those investing in USD or in kind (BTC, ETH & USDC). In-kind investors
                combine the benefits of a long position on liquid cryptocurrencies with high yield returns from arbitrage trading.

            <p class="leading-7">
                Arbitrage is the process of simultaneous buying and selling of an asset from different
                platforms, exchanges or locations to cash in on the price difference. The price differential of
                the same asset in different markets is known as arbitrage and profiting from the differential is
                known as arbitrage trading.
            </p> <br>
            <p class="leading-7"> Arbitrage opportunities exist due to inherent inefficiencies in the financial markets. Supply
                and demand are the primary driving factors behind the markets, and a change in either of them
                can affect an assetâ€™s price.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="leading-7">
                In real life, arbitrage opportunities (if any) exist only for brief periods since most of the
                arbitrage trading has been taken over by algorithm-based trading in matured markets. These
                algorithms are quick to spot and capture arbitrage opportunities, making it hard for human traders to keep track.

            <p class="leading-7">
                Cryptocurrency markets exhibit periods of large, recurrent arbitrage opportunities across
                exchanges. A number of features make the cryptocurrency market a unique place for trading
                arbitrage and price formation. There are many nonintegrated exchanges that are independently
                owned and exist in parallel across countries.
                On an individual basis the majority of these exchanges function like traditional equity markets
                where traders submit buy and sell orders, and the exchange clears trades based on a centralised
                order book.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="leading-7">
                However, in contrast to traditional, regulated equity markets, the cryptocurrency market lacks
                any provisions to ensure that investors receive the best price when executing trades. The
                absence of such mechanisms increases the role of arbitrageurs who can trade across different
                markets.
