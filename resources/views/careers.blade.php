                        different performance to their investors. A key differentiator in the quantitative investment
                        management industry is the available for the company of human talent capable of analyzing the
                        available data in a better way and gain better insights than other companies in the same space.
                        In order to explore data in a more meaningful way, and to develop better technology, we look for
