                OTC is trading happening directly between two parties without the involvement of exchange. It is
                a direct medium of exchange and no one beyond the involved parties are privy to price and volume
                in which various assets are traded. Simply put, OTC desks deal in immense volumes with seeming
                opacity, outside the periphery of the public eye.

            <p class="leading-7">
                Crypto OTC is when trading of crypto is involved directly between the two parties. That trade
                can be crypto-to-crypto or Fiat-to-Crypto. The trade always occurs between a dedicated trading
                desk with the involvement of another institution who is providing OTC services, known as
                counterparty.

            <p class="leading-7">
                Buying or selling a huge volume of crypto is difficult. Mainly because no single entity sells
                huge volumes all alone and when buying from different traders, you would become a victim of
                slippage. The first trade would be at market price but subsequent ones would be at higher market
                price because the trading would increase investors interest. And soon the last lot would be
                available at a much higher price than what you have started with. This is known as Slippage.
            </p> <br>
            <p class="leading-7">
                So it is better to spread your purchase through multiple exchanges. Hence OTC services. These
                would quote you one price and would get all the required volume of crypto at that price for you.
                They excel at sourcing large volumes of crypto assets.

            <p class=" leading-7">
                Some OTC Service providers use this method where they source whatever crypto you are buying
                through their own funds. They assume the risk in this process. The risk is that they have to
                source the crypto assets in a way they can make a profit and not end up incurring huge losses.
                Once agreed upon assets are purchased, the client would wire the money and get the crypto assets
                in his wallet as per agreement.
