                In crypto assets, liquidity is the ability of a token to be easily converted into
                cash or other crypto. Liquidity is significant for every marketable crypto asset; as
                low liquidity means market instability

                With our Liquidity Enhancement services, you get elevated liquidity which shows that there is a
                persistent market with some variation in cost. A liquid crypto asset or exchange is hugely
                successful as in high liquidity, buy and sell becomes easier because of a large number of
                competitors.

            <p>Blockarb employs software and trading tactics to bring in liquidity and generate investor
                interest in crypto assets. Newly launched crypto assets struggle to generate investor interest
                due to low liquidity. With Blockarb, crypto companies get a focussed approach on increasing the
                trading activity.

                Our Liquidity Enhancement services guarantees that costs are steady and not liable to great
                swings ensuing from huge trades which could influence digital assets costs. We provide
                multi-asset liquidity together with access to FIX protocol and historical data.

                Cryptocurrency markets exhibit periods of large, recurrent arbitrage opportunities across
                exchanges. A number of features make the cryptocurrency market a unique place for trading
                arbitrage and price formation. There are many nonintegrated exchanges that are independently
                owned and exist in parallel across countries.
                On an individual basis the majority of these exchanges function like traditional equity markets
                where traders submit buy and sell orders, and the exchange clears trades based on a centralised
                order book.
