                        capital.
                        Since our strategies are fully systematic, we developed most of our investment technology
                        in-house in order to have control over execution quality and satisfy the requirements

                        <p class=" mt-5">The first step in the deployment of a new quantitative investment strategy is
                            the
                            retrieval of data. While years ago data was in limited supply because of the lack of proper
                            methods for storing and processing data, today the advancement of technology and the
                            reduction
                            in the cost of storage has massively increased the amount of data stored by organizations
                            from
                            all industries. We can say that the problem today is the opposite, in other words too much
                            data
                            is stored and often it cannot be effectively analyzed by human operators, leading to the new
                            field of Big Data.</p> <br>
                        <p>
                            In order to support our team in the objective of discovering new sources of alpha, we take
                            advantage of Big Data by looking at many different datasets from various fields. They
                            include
                            traditional historical financial time series data, fundamental data about companies and
                            macroeconomic sectors, and more sophisticated alternative datasets.

                        <p>Our quantitative developers continuously develop new technological tools to support the
                            requirements of our data scientists to efficiently retrieve and store very large amounts of
                            historical data.</p> <br>

                        <p class=" mt-5">A common problem in dealing with data is that most of the time the datasets
                            contain errors, or a not structured in the way required by the quantitative researchers and
                            analysts, thus they need to be cleaned. While years ago, where the amount of data to by
                            analyzed
                            was limited and it could be done by a human operator, nowadays the vast amount of data
                            recorded
                            makes it impractical to manually clean the data at disposal and makes it necessary for
                            organizations to adopt automated tools.</p> <br>
                        <p>
                            In order to support the vast amount of data that needs to be cleaned and checked for
                            potential
                            errors, our technology team has implemented various automated tools that help our quants run
                            their analyses and reduce the occurrence of faulty data which could lead to biased
                            backtesting
                            and erroneous conclusions.

                            In order to run their analyses on dataset containing millions of records, our quants need
                            advanced technological tools, which enable them to run sophisticated queries and statistical
                            analyses on data with speed, to visualize patterns, and to discover relationships within

                            run

                        <p>
                            Since the backtesting phase is very time consuming due to the large amount of historical
                            data on
                            which to run the strategy, our quants need advanced algorithms and enough computing

                            power in order to complete their tests as fast as possible.
